# record_video.py mousename

# It should save the videos in /home/pi/Videos
# Note(shouldn't it saved in the external drive?)
# and it would create files called:
# mousename_2021-01-24_150723.avi   (the video)
# mousename_2021-01-24_150723.log   (frame timestamps)

# and when it receives a SIGINT (either a Ctrl-C or a kill -2) it would gracefully
# stop recording, close the files, and exit.
# function takes in the session information, and it uses the information
# to create directory and video file...
# this function is called when the program receives a SIGINT
